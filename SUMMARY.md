## ‚ú® Final Thoughts

### For Beginners:
**Don't skip the Simple Version!** It might seem basic, but it teaches fundamental concepts that are essential for the Full Version. Building the Simple Version first will make the Full Version much easier to understand.

### For Advanced Learners:
If you're already comfortable with Java, feel free to go directly to the Full Version. However, you might still find the Simple Version useful as a teaching tool or as a basis for comparison.

### The Best Learning Path:
**Start Simple ‚Üí Add Features ‚Üí Build Complex**

This is how real software evolves, and it's the best way to learn!
